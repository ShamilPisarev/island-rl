# CLAUDE.md — working notes

Assume you are starting cold with only this file and `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`. This is
the state of the project, the decisions behind it, and the things that will bite
you.

## Current state

**Milestone 1 (survival + foraging) is complete and verified.** Milestones 2–6
have not been started — do not start them without reading §3 of the brief.

- `pytest` passes.
- The viewer has been verified in a browser against real replays, including the
  schema-mismatch failure paths.
- Training runs end to end and beats the random baseline (numbers in
  `runs/<name>/metrics.csv` and `runs/<name>/baselines.json`).

## Layout notes

Built at the repo root rather than in a nested `island/` directory as the brief's
tree suggested — the repo *is* the project. Two files exist that the brief's tree
did not list:

- `sim/config.py` — YAML into frozen dataclasses. Needed by world, ppo, train and
  evaluate, so it did not belong inside any of them.
- `sim/make_fake_replay.py` — generates a replay without training, so the viewer
  could be built and verified before a policy existed (brief §5.2).

## Decisions, and why

**Auto-eat rather than an explicit eat action.** The brief left this open. Agents
eat automatically when `hunger < eat_threshold` and they are carrying food. Two
reasons: it keeps the action space at exactly the 10 actions the brief pins down,
and — the real reason — the eat reward is *scaled by hunger deficit*. With an
explicit action, an agent would be paid more for eating later, i.e. rewarded for
starving itself closer to death before acting. Auto-eat removes the pathology
instead of tuning around it.

**`hunger` counts down.** Per the brief it starts at 100, drains per tick, and
`<= 0` is death. So it is a satiety meter with a misleading name. The name is
kept for consistency with the brief; every docstring flags it. Do not "fix" the
direction without changing the observation normalisation and the viewer's colour
thresholds together.

**Observation distances use `observation.distance_scale` (20), not the island
diameter.** The brief said "distance-normalised". Dividing by the diameter (80)
squashes a bush 5 units away to 0.06 and destroys exactly the near-field gradient
the policy needs. Offsets are divided by 20 and clipped to ±1: full resolution
where it matters, saturation far away. Tunable in config.

**Padding is zeros, and magnitudes are [0, 1] not [-1, 1].** Berry counts and
neighbour hunger are normalised to [0, 1] so a zero-padded slot reads as "an
entity with nothing in it at zero offset", which no real entity is. Had those
channels been centred at zero, padding would have been indistinguishable from a
half-full bush sitting on top of you.

**Walking into the sea is impossible, not fatal.** Movement is projected back
onto the disc; the agent slides along the shoreline and loses the tick. The brief
wanted agents to "learn not to walk into the sea"; drowning would teach that
harder but adds a death mode the brief never specified. If foraging near the edge
looks bad, this is the knob.

**Bush layout is resampled every episode** (`bushes.resample_each_episode`).
Observations are egocentric with no absolute coordinates, so a fixed map cannot
be memorised anyway, but resampling stops the policy overfitting to one
arrangement of clusters. Set false if you want a stable map for eyeballing.

**Death is termination, the tick limit is truncation.** An agent that starves has
genuinely zero future value. An episode that hits `max_ticks` does not — those
agents were alive and would have carried on. `ppo.py` bootstraps `V(final_obs)`
into the reward at a truncation boundary. Collapsing the two teaches the policy
that the world ends at tick 600 and quietly poisons every value estimate near the
horizon.

**Dead agents keep their slot.** They are stepped every tick with a zero
observation and a forced `idle`, and dropped from GAE and every loss term via an
`active` mask. Masking the *loss* rather than the buffer keeps every tensor
rectangular. This is the part of `ppo.py` most likely to break under a change;
`tests/test_ppo.py` pins it from three directions (activity monotonicity, exact
row count reaching the update, forced-idle actions).

## Gotchas

**Berries gathered is a weak metric once a policy is competent.** Auto-eat makes
consumption homeostatic: a competent forager eats exactly as often as hunger
arithmetic demands and gathers exactly enough to top its inventory back up. The
scripted forager returns *identical* totals across wildly different noise levels
for this reason. Judge policies on lifespan and deaths; berries only separates
the incompetent from the competent, not the good from the great.

**Value loss rising is not a bug.** As the policy improves, returns grow, so the
critic's targets grow, so absolute value loss climbs. It only falls once the
return scale settles. Use `explained_variance` to judge the critic — it is
scale-free. (On the smoke-test bandit EV pins to 0 no matter what, because that
task's return is i.i.d. and genuinely unpredictable from the observation.)

**The viewer cannot list a directory.** It is a static page: no directory
listing over http, and `fetch` on `file://` is blocked outright. `sim/replay.py`
maintains `viewer/replays/index.json` and the viewer reads that. Anything that
writes a replay outside `ReplayRecorder.save` must call `update_manifest` or the
file will not appear in the dropdown. Drag-and-drop always works, including from
`file://`.

**The viewer needs network on first load** — Three.js comes from a CDN via an
import map, as the brief specified. There is no bundler and no vendored copy.

**Replay schema is versioned and the viewer fails loudly.** `SCHEMA_VERSION` in
`sim/replay.py`, `SUPPORTED_SCHEMA` in `viewer/main.js`. The viewer also
cross-checks the file's own `tick_fields.agent` against the column order it
expects, so reordering columns cannot silently shift what gets rendered. Bump the
version on *any* change to the tick encoding, and update both sides.

**Determinism is CPU-only and covers the whole stack.** Same seed + same config
gives byte-identical replays and identical training curves. `PPOTrainer` owns its
own `np.random.Generator` for minibatch shuffling — do not reach for global numpy
state anywhere in the training path, it silently breaks the guarantee.
`VecWorld` seeds per-env streams via `SeedSequence`, not `seed + i`.

## Reference points

Measured on the shipped `config/default.yaml`, 20 episodes, seeds 10000+:

| policy | mean lifespan | of 600 ticks | deaths/ep |
|---|---|---|---|
| random actions | ~302 | 50% | 5.1 |
| scripted greedy forager | 600 | 100% | 0.0 |

The scripted forager (`policy.greedy_forager_actions`) reads *only* the 26-dim
observation, not world state. That is on purpose: it proves the observation is
sufficient for the task, so any failure to learn is the algorithm's fault rather
than the sensor's. Treat it as a soft ceiling for memoryless reactive foraging —
it is not optimal, it just never wastes a tick.

## What is next (Milestone 2)

Split the shared policy into per-agent policies initialised from the shared
checkpoint, then train independently. Nothing in `policy.py` knows how many
agents exist, so forking is a matter of holding a list of `ActorCritic` instances
and indexing by agent id in `ppo.py`'s collect and update. The observation
deliberately contains no agent identity, so the shared policy has no per-agent
behaviour baked in to unlearn.
